            <p class="p3em">This website uses the Three.js library and bundling with vite in order to create an interactive
                experience in which users can learn more about different types of plants native to Colorado. It includes 
                interative features such as mousing over a collage of different images, orbiting around 3D models, and 
                finding more resources to learn more.

            <p class="p3em">We created a single-page React app showcasing information about the solar system. We used a Card component
                as well as a 3D model component in order to display a 3D model of the solar system, as well as information and highlights
                about each of the planets. This assignment was a good way to practice react and understand the framework, as well
                as explore the React Three Fiber library for the 3D models. It was difficult to deploy the site as we bundled with Vite, which posed some challenges with our file structure.
